# OSU-SFML-CPP
A very barebones copy of the [Osu!](osu.ppy.sh) game made in C++17 using SFML.

## Status
 - The game doesn't support doing anything yet, hmhmm...

## Dependencies
 - [SFML-2.5.1](https://www.sfml-dev.org)
 - [nlohmann](https://github.com/nlohmann/json)
 - [imgui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui) (and with the sfml support)
 - [lzma](https://docs.python.org/3/library/lzma.html) (for using @HaselLoyance's [OsuParser](https://github.com/HaselLoyance/osu-parser))
